    I enjoy programming. I have my own <a href="https://github.com/wilsongp">personal projects</a>
    to challange myself. It's why I chose it as a profession. However, it is exactly that.
    A profession. I also happen to enjoy spending time with my wife, hockey, hiking, and cooking delicious food.
    40+ hours per week at the office and the few I spend at home are plenty to sate my appetite. As the clich√© goes:
    "Variety is the spice of life, That gives it all its flavor."
